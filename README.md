# Coding-text-open-ends
This python code takes text responses and turns them into codes based on a dictionary. The ideas is quite simple. It assigns the responses to all of the levels with which it shares any words. To account for misspelings and the like, a measure of the similarity between words is calculated and if two words are more similar to each other than a certain threshold, they are counted as the same word.

The input files are not provided due to company data privacy rules. If you wish to be able to run this code, please contact me at payam.bagheri@gmail.com
